#You are given a tuple that consists of integers and other tuples, which in turn can also contain tuples.
#Your task is to find out how deep this structure is or how deep the nesting of these tuples is.
#For example, in the (1, 2, 3) tuple the depth of nesting is 1. And in the (1, 2, (3,)) tuple the depth of nesting is 2,
#since one of the elements of the first tuple is also a tuple. And in the (1, 2, (3, (4,))) tuple the depth of nesting
#is 3, since one of the elements of the first tuple is a tuple, but since inside it contains another tuple, it increases
#the depth by one, so the nesting depth turns out to be 3.
#Itâ€™s important to note that an empty tuple also increases the depth of the structure, that is, () - indicates the
#nesting depth 1, ((),) - indicates the nesting depth 2.
